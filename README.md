* Smooth Scrolling algorithm that strikes a great balance between fluidity and control. Allows you to change mouse scrolling direction independently of trackpad scrolling direction.
* 100% free, light on system resources, and fully open source. There is no status bar item. Mac Mouse Fix aims to be as clutter free as possible.
