This script helps to keep .strings files in sync with source code and IB files.
It's a replacement for bartycrouch.

Manual testing steps:

- [x] Remove semicolon on a kv-pair
    -> Should throw an error, and not write anything
- [x] Multiline values like addField hint (N7H-9j-DIr.title) don't duplicate or anything

- [x] Insert key in source file
    - Test both IB and code source file (insert in code using NSLocalizedString)
    -> Result: String shows up in .strings file with correct comment and empty value. (Localizable.strings is for source code)
- [x] Delete autogenerated comment in .strings file, Add inline comment, add value, reorder
    - Test both IB and code source file
    -> Result: Inline comment and value are preserved. Order and autogenerated comment are restored. (It's important to preserve inline comments for our !IS_OK flags)
    ->      Currently 03.01.2024 this sometimes deletes surrounding values. But I can't reproduce this despite best efforts. Very strange.
- [x] Add superfluous kv-pair, add comment above
    -> Result: Superfluous kv-pair is moved to start of file, comment is preserved
    
- [x] StateOfLocalization doesn't change after this updates everything.

    - On location of English (development language) UI strings:
        
        Explanation:
        - For IB, the English strings are directly in the source (IB) files
            (This isn't the case for every Xcode project, but we chose do t the case for the MMF project.)
        - On the other hand, for sourcecode, the English strings not directly in the source (sourcecode) files, instead they are inside en.lproj/Localizable.strings.
        
        Thoughts:
        - In update_ib_comments we don't update English .strings files - because currently in MMF there are no English .strings files for IB files - that's because the IB files hold the English UI strings directly.
        - Maybe we should've specified development language values directly in the source code using `NSLocalizedStringWithDefaultValue` instead of inside en.lproj. That way we wouldn't need en.lproj at all.
        - Not sure anymore why we chose to do it with en.lproj instead of all source code for English. But either way, I don't think it's worth it to change now.

    Notes:
    - On the line-based approach vs match-based approach:
        - line-based approach:
            - goes through the text line-by line, and applies the regex to each line.
            - That makes for simple code, and it allows us to verify that the .strings file has the correct format, instead of doing weird stuff like the match-based approach.
            - We used splitlines(True) to iterate lines, but this didn't work, because the strings sometimes contain the character 'LINE SEPARATOR' (U+2028) if you enter a linebreak in IB, and splitlines splits at those characters. (Example for this is the '+' field hint.)
                - Note: Gave GitHub Feedback at: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/84092
            - But by simply using .split('\n') it seems to work!
        - match-based approach:
            - The match-based applies the regext for finding kv-pairs to the whole string, and then iterates through the matches.
            - This works fine, butttt if you forget to put a semicolon at the end, then it will consider the whole kv-pair part of a comment, and will simply delete it.
                This has happened to me a few times when I was tired and I HATE this behaviour. That's why we're going back to the line-based approach with some additional checks to make sure everything is well-formatted.
    - Somehow we seem to be replacing consecutive blank lines before and after comments with single blank lines in the output of the script. 
        That's nice, but I don't understand why it's happending. Might be coming from this function. Edit: It think it's just because we replace the comments and the comments from the generated content don't have double line breaks.
