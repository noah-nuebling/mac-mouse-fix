### Blockquotes
*Displaying the GitHub alert-style blockquotes requires javascript. MMF 2.2.3 and 3.0.2 don't have js enabled for rendering update notes. I plan to enable it for future releases using Sparkle's `SUEnableJavaScript` setting.*

> **This is a normal**
>
> Blockquote
>
> Some text
> ...Single break\
> ...Backslash (\\) single break
>
> ...Double break

> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.

> [!CAUTION]  
> If you put more than one space after [!CAUTION], then pandoc will insert weird extra linebreaks. Update: Fixed this in our js code.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> This note has a double line break after [!NOTE]
