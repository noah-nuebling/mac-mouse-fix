<hr />

<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.0.4</strong> improves privacy, efficiency,

and reliability.<br />

It introduces a new offline licensing system, and fixes several

important bugs.</p>

<h3 id="enhanced-privacy-efficiency">Enhanced Privacy &amp;

Efficiency</h3>

<p>3.0.4 introduces a new offline license validation system that

minimizes internet connections as much as possible. This improves

privacy and saves your computer’s system resources. When licensed, the

app now operates 100% offline!</p>

<details>

<summary>

<b>Click here for more details</b>

</summary>

<p>Previous versions validated licenses online at every launch,

potentially allowing connection logs to be stored by third-party servers

(GitHub and Gumroad). The new system eliminates unnecessary connections

– after the initial license activation, it only connects to the internet

if local license data is corrupted. <br><br> While no user behavior was

ever recorded by me personally, the previous system theoretically

allowed third-party servers to log IP addresses and connection times.

Gumroad could also log your license key and potentially correlate it to

any personal info they recorded about you when you bought Mac Mouse Fix.

<br><br> I didn’t consider these subtle privacy issues when I built the

original licensing system, but now, Mac Mouse Fix is as private and

internet-free as possible! <br><br> Also see

<a href=https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/976#issuecomment-2140955801>GitHub

comment</a> of mine.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a bug where macOS would sometimes get stuck when using ‘Click

and Drag’ for ‘Spaces &amp; Mission Control’.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug where keyboard shortcuts in System Settings would

sometimes get deleted when using Mac Mouse Fix ‘Click’ actions such as

‘Mission Control’.</li>

<li>Fixed <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22%27Free%20days%20are%20over%27%20bug%22">a

bug</a> where the app would sometimes stop working and show a

notification that the ‘Free days are over’ to users who had already

bought the app.

<ul>

<li>If you experienced this bug, I sincerely apologize for the

inconvenience. You can apply for a <a

href="https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?message=&amp;target=mmf-apply-for-refund">refund

here</a>.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Made it impossible to enter spaces and linebreaks in the text field

on the ‘Activate License’ screen.

<ul>

<li>This was a common point of confusion, because it is very easy to

accidentally select a hidden linebreak when copying your license key

from Gumroad’s emails.<br />

</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Improved the way the application retrieves its main window, which

may have fixed a bug where the ‘Activate License’ screen sometimes fails

to appear.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="dropped-unofficial-support-for-macos-10.14-mojave">Dropped

(Unofficial) Support for macOS 10.14 Mojave</h3>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3 officially supports macOS 11 Big Sur and later.

However, for users willing to accept some glitches and graphical issues,

Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.3 and earlier could still be used on macOS 10.14.4

Mojave.</p>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.4 drops that support and <strong>now requires macOS

10.15 Catalina</strong>.<br />

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this. This change allowed me

to implement the improved licensing system using modern Swift features.

Mojave users can continue using Mac Mouse Fix <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/3.0.3">3.0.3</a>

or the <a

href="https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mmf2-latest">latest

version of Mac Mouse Fix 2</a>. I hope that’s a good solution for

everyone.</p>

<h3 id="under-the-hood-improvements">Under-the-hood Improvements</h3>

<ul>

<li>Implemented a new ‘MFDataClass’ system allowing for more powerful

data modeling while keeping Mac Mouse Fix’s config file human-readable

and human-editable.</li>

<li>Built support for adding payment platforms other than Gumroad. So in

the future, there might be localized checkouts, and the app could be

sold to different countries.</li>

<li>Improved logging which allows me to create more effective “Debug

Builds” for users who experience hard-to-reproduce bugs.</li>

<li>Many other small improvements and cleanup work.</li>

</ul>

<p><em>Edited with excellent assistance from Claude.</em></p>
