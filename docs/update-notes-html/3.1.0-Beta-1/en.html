<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.1.0 Beta 1</strong> brings a great new

translation system, which has been in the works for a while.<br />

There are also some UI improvements.</p>

<h3 id="new-localization-system">New localization system!</h3>

<ul>

<li>It is now super easy to contribute high-quality translations to Mac

Mouse Fix, with 0 technical background required.</li>

<li>There are lots of annotated screenshots and comments, and a great

search function, so translators can easily understand exactly how their

translations appear in-app.

<ul>

<li>I think the screenshots and the translation UI

(<code>Xcloc Editor</code> app) are the highest quality on the market,

and I hope they will help you provide great translations!</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Almost all parts of the project are translatable now, including the

‘Captured Buttons Guide’, the GitHub Readme, the Website, and more.

<ul>

<li>All these parts of the project can be translated from one

centralized place with easy cross-referencing using the

<code>Xcloc Editor</code> app, so it’s easy for translators to keep

everything consistent.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>The system is set up to be very easy to maintain, so as Mac Mouse

Fix evolves and new screens or texts are added, everything will update

automatically.</li>

<li>Disclaimer: I use the word ‘easy’ a lot. The workflows are easy, but

thinking of great translations is of course still a lot of hard and

respectable work! There are just less barriers in the way now.</li>

</ul>

<p>New translations have already been generously provided by the

following people:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Eduardo Rodrigues</strong>: 🇧🇷 Brazilian Portuguese

translations</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/DimitriDR"><span class="citation"

data-cites="DimitriDR">@DimitriDR</span></a>: 🇫🇷 French

href="macmousefix.com">the website</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Thanks for your work!</p>

<p>However, <strong>all languages still need work</strong>, since much

new stuff has been made translatable.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[!TIP] Check out the new <a

href="https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mmf-localization-contribution">Translation

Guide</a> if you’d like to help bring great translations to Mac Mouse

Fix users across the world! 🌎</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="other-changes">Other changes</h3>

<p>When using Mac Mouse Fix in English, not much has changed, but a few

things have been updated in the UI, and a lot has shifted under the

hood, to help make translations better:</p>

<ul>

<li>Refined look for the little popup notifications.</li>

<li>Clearer tooltips and errors in various places.</li>

<li>The escape key can now be used everywhere to dismiss notifications,

sheets, and popups.</li>

<li>A ‘Help Translate’ link has been added to the About Tab.</li>

<li>The width of views and popups has been adjusted to look great in

various languages.</li>

<li>Better text layout for Chinese and Korean, which had text-wrapping

issues in some of the little popup notifications.</li>

<li>Replaced Markdown parsing library to fix some formatting bugs in

Chinese and Korean.</li>

<li>Lots more under-the-hood changes and improvements.</li>

</ul>
