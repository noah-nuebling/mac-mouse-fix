Mac Mouse Fix **3.1.0 Beta 1** brings a great new translation system, which has been in the works for a while.\
There are also some UI improvements.

### New localization system! 

- It is now super easy to contribute high-quality translations to Mac Mouse Fix, with 0 technical background required.
- There are lots of annotated screenshots and comments, and a great search function, so translators can easily understand exactly how their translations appear in-app.
    - I think the screenshots and the translation UI (`Xcloc Editor` app) are the highest quality on the market, and I hope they will help you provide great translations!
- Almost all parts of the project are translatable now, including the 'Captured Buttons Guide', the GitHub Readme, the Website, and more.
    - All these parts of the project can be translated from one centralized place with easy cross-referencing using the `Xcloc Editor` app, so it's easy for translators to keep everything consistent.
- The system is set up to be very easy to maintain, so as Mac Mouse Fix evolves and new screens or texts are added, everything will update automatically.
- Disclaimer: I use the word 'easy' a lot. The workflows are easy, but thinking of great translations is of course still a lot of hard and respectable work! There are just less barriers in the way now.




New translations have already been generously provided by the following people:

- **Eduardo Rodrigues**: 🇧🇷 Brazilian Portuguese translations
- [@DimitriDR](https://github.com/DimitriDR): 🇫🇷 French translations
- [@hasanbeder](https://github.com/hasanbeder): 🇹🇷 Turkish translations
- [Petr Pavlík](http://www.petrpavlik.com): 🇨🇿 Czech translations

Thanks for your work!

However, **all languages still need work**, since much new stuff has been made translatable. 

Therefore:

### Other changes 

When using Mac Mouse Fix in English, not much has changed, but a few things have been updated in the UI, and a lot has shifted under the hood, to help make translations better:

- Refined look for the little popup notifications.
- Clearer tooltips and errors in various places.
- The escape key can now be used everywhere to dismiss notifications, sheets, and popups.
- A 'Help Translate' link has been added to the About Tab.
- The width of views and popups has been adjusted to look great in various languages.
- Better text layout for Chinese and Korean, which had text-wrapping issues in some of the little popup notifications.
- Replaced Markdown parsing library to fix some formatting bugs in Chinese and Korean.
- Lots more under-the-hood changes and improvements.
