- Use the `Localization Screenshot Taker - Dont Build MMF__` build scheme to quickly iterate on the `LocalizationScreenshotTaker` code itself. [Dec 2025]
    -> This greatly speeds up iteration time, since it doesn't have to build the whole project every time you make a change to the automation/'test' code.
- Caution/learning: Previously we made this the default – so that you always had to manually build the app first – but I forgot that sooo many times and then spent time debugging, so it wasted a lot of time. [Dec 2025]
