Planning for updated MMF 3 Captured Buttons Guide: [Aug 2025]

- There are two aspects to the Guide:
    - Practical user problems caused by capturing
        - Helping people solve these are the core purpose of this Guide
        - List of practical problems I can think of
            - Terminal pasting, Browser-link-opening 
                - (Due to Middle Click capturing)
            - Blender orbiting 
                - (Due to Middle Drag capturing)
            - Browser back-and-forward 
                - (Due to Side-Button Capturing) 
                - (I don't remember actually hearing issue reports about this.)
            - Video-game remapping of side-buttons 
                - (Due to Side-Button Capturing) 
                - (Which videogames do that?)
            - Using MOS, Logi Options, or another smooth scrolling app for scrolling, and using MMF only for buttons
                - (Due to scrollwheel capturing) 
                - (Not sure if you need to fully uncapture to make this work – Can't you just turn off smooth-scrolling in MMF? But it would still be nice for users to know how to get MMF CPU usage during scrolling to 0% if they don't need it.)
    - Instilling fundamental mental model of how capturing works
        - If people understand this, they can then understand how to solve their specific practical problems. Maybe even ones we're not aware of.
        - This may make up the majority of the content, but it's **in service** of people being able to solve the practical problems.

Content:
    - Core explanation of 'capturing' 
        - should probably be shared for scrollwheel and buttons
        - ... But that might make it more abstract and harder to understand? 
    - Practical UI-based guides 'How do I know what is captured' and 'how to uncapture' 
        - should probably be specific to scrollwheel / buttons and should probably use screenshots so it's very easy-to-follow
    - Reference to practical problems (See above)
        - People with those practical problems should be naturally guided to this article and it should be clear that they need to read this to sole the problem.
            - Leading with the abstract explanations of what 'capturing' means might not make this obvious?
                - Maybe list the practical issues explicitly in a scannable way.
            - Think about the 'user journey' for people with those practical problems!
        - Also write about how people can solve those practical issues caused by capturing *without* uncapturing (e.g. Middle Click action, Scroll & Navigate for Orbiting, etc.)
            - I guess you could think of uncapturing as a bit of a nuclear/last resort option (?) (but useful to understand)
        - Probably pull in the Blender Orbiting section from Readme > Questions
            - Are there other sections we should pull in?

<!-- 
    Philosophical: The current draft explains the reasoning and addresses the problem cases I'm aware of in great detail. The old version just tried to instill fundamental understanding of capturing and let users figure out their usecases (and mentions some problem-cases briefly at the end to say "here's how to solve this without uncapturing")

    Update: [Sep 2025] It seems we since went back to something closer to the old structure.

        New Philosophical thoughts: I think I program too much. I was too in my head with this. This isn't about making some technically perfect thing, it's just about helping people solve problems with the app.

# Captured Buttons

When you install Mac Mouse Fix, you'll notice that the **buttons on your mouse perform new functions**.

However, you may also notice that, some of the old **functions that those buttons used to perform no longer work**.

This may disrupt your workflow, if you previously used the buttons to:

- Click and Drag the middle button to **Orbit around objects in 3d modeling apps like Blender.**
- Click the middle button to **paste text in the Terminal**
- Click the middle button to **open links in a new tab in Safari and other browsers**
    - Click the middle button to **close tabs in Safari and other browsers**. 
        (Is this worth mentioning separately?)
- Click the side buttons (mouse button 4 and 5) to **go back and forward in Chrome, VSCode, and other apps.**
- Remapped the mouse buttons to **Custom assigned functions in video games or pro apps** (like ...? VSCode?).

The buttons will no longer perform their usual actions because the buttons have been **captured** by Mac Mouse Fix – that means Mac Mouse Fix takes **complete control** of those buttons and **other apps no longer get notified** when you press those buttons. (/ "can no longer see" those buttons.) 

Mac Mouse Fix needs to hide the button from other apps so that you can perform gestures and actions in Mac Mouse Fix without accidentally triggering functions on those other apps at the same time.

## What can I do to restore the functionality of a button before it was captured by MMF?

To get back the functionality that you were used to before installing Mac Mouse Fix, there are 3 approaches.

1. Leave the Button captured, but assign functionality inside MMF that restores the original functionality that you were used to.
2. Uncapture the button – if you delete **all the bindings** in MMF for a button, then that button will no longer be captured and will behave exactly as if Mac Mouse Fix was disabled
3. Disable Mac Mouse Fix entirely (Switch off `General > Enable Mac Mouse Fix`) – then MMF will not interfere with the functioning of your mouse at all.

### 1. Restoring old functionality – without uncapturing


 - Assign Click and Drag to 'Scroll & Navigate'. It will simulate trackpad-swiping with 2 fingers which lets you orbit in Blender among other things. However if your computer getting slow this might become less responsive (Working on that.)
    Solves usecases: 
        - **Orbit around objects in 3d modeling apps like Blender.**
        - **go back and forward in Chrome, VSCode, and other apps.**
- Assign Clicking to 'Middle Click' action in MMF.
    Solves usecases: 
        - **paste text in the Terminal**
        - **open links in a new tab in Safari and other browsers** 
            - and **close tabs in Safari and other browsers**
        - **Custom assigned functions in video games or pro apps**
            - Caveats: Only 'click' actions will work, not 'Click and Drag' actions – because MMF sends the mouseup and mousedown event at once. (Necessary to avoid interference with other MMF gestures assigned to the same button)
- Assign clicking to 'Back' and 'Forward' actions in MMF
    Solves usecases:
        - **go back and forward in Chrome, VSCode, and other apps.**
        - **Custom assigned functions in video games or pro apps**
            - Why this works? The 'Back' and 'Forward' actions will actually simulate MB 4/5 clicks in video games and pro apps (since MMF 3.0.6), so you can then remap MB 4/5 in those games/apps and it'll work.
            - Caveats: Only 'click' actions will work, not 'Click and Drag' actions – because MMF sends the mouseup and mousedown event at once. (Necessary to avoid interference with other MMF gestures assigned to the same button)

### 2. Restoring old functionality – by uncapturing

(Maybe insert the explanations of the fundamental capturing concepts from the old guide.)

# Botões do Mouse Capturados


Ao usar o Mac Mouse Fix, você pode ter visto uma mensagem dizendo que um botão do seu mouse foi "capturado" pelo Mac Mouse Fix.

<img height=200 src="../../../../..//Markdown/Media/Autogenerated/pt-BR/CapturedButtons0.jpg">"

Neste artigo, você vai entender o que isso significa, quais problemas pode causar e como contornar.

## O que significa "capturar" um botão do mouse?

Um botão capturado pelo Mac Mouse Fix deixa de ser visto por outros apps ou pelo macOS.
As funções que ele executaria normalmente não funcionam enquanto ele estiver capturado.

**Exemplo**: normalmente você pode voltar e avançar no Chrome clicando nos botões laterais (botões 4 e 5) do mouse.
Quando esses botões são capturados pelo Mac Mouse Fix, isso deixa de funcionar. Em vez disso, eles só disparam as ações atribuídas no Mac Mouse Fix.

**Por que o Mac Mouse Fix faz isso?** Ele esconde os botões de outros apps para evitar que você acione funções por engano ao usar gestos do Mac Mouse Fix.
Por exemplo, ao clicar e arrastar o botão 4 para trocar de mesa, você acabaria **ao mesmo tempo** voltando uma página no Chrome.

## Como sei quais botões estão sendo capturados pelo Mac Mouse Fix?

Qualquer botão que aparece no lado esquerdo da aba "Botões" está sendo capturado pelo Mac Mouse Fix.

Na imagem a seguir, **"Botão do Meio"**, **"Botão 5"** e **"Botão 4"** estão sendo capturados: <br>

<img width=600  src="../../../../..//Markdown/Media/Autogenerated/pt-BR/CapturedButtons1.jpg">"

## Como impedir que o Mac Mouse Fix capture um botão do mouse?

Para impedir o Mac Mouse Fix de capturar um botão, exclua todas as entradas desse botão na aba "Botões".
Você pode apagar uma entrada clicando no botão "-" à esquerda.

No exemplo abaixo, você impediria que o **"Botão 4"** fosse capturado clicando nos dois botões **"-"** destacados:

<img width=600  src="../../../../..//Markdown/Media/Autogenerated/pt-BR/CapturedButtons2.jpg">"

## Como restaurar a funcionalidade original de um botão?

Para fazer um botão se comportar como antes de instalar o Mac Mouse Fix, você pode:

1. **Impedir que o botão seja capturado** – como descrito acima.

2. Simplesmente **desativar o Mac Mouse Fix** – assim nenhum botão será capturado.

3. **Atribuir ações específicas ao botão no Mac Mouse Fix** – desse modo você recupera certas funções *mesmo enquanto o botão está capturado*:

| Botão | Função original | Ação no Mac Mouse Fix |
|----------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Botão do Meio | Abrir links do navegador em nova aba | "Clique do Meio"<br>(Pode ser atribuído ao **clique** de um botão) |
| Botão do Meio | Colar texto no terminal | "Clique do Meio"<br>(Pode ser atribuído ao **clique** de um botão) |
| Botão 4 / Botão 5 | Voltar / avançar no Chrome e outros apps | "Voltar" / "Avançar"<br>(Pode ser atribuído ao **clique** de um botão) |
| Botão do Meio | Orbitar objetos no Blender (e outros apps 3D) | "Rolar e Navegar"<br>(Pode ser atribuído ao **clicar e arrastar** de um botão) |


Assim você mantém a funcionalidade usual do botão e ainda atribui funções *extras* no Mac Mouse Fix.

Should we add explanations / context for the table above?
- [ ] Maybe add screenshot of how to select the actions in MMF? (as in the MMF2 Guide.)
- [ ] Maybe explain how **'Zurück'** / **'Vorwärts'** simulate MB 4/5 clicks in third-party apps
- [ ] Maybe explain how **'Scrollen & Navigieren'** simulates 2-finger Trackpad swipes

<!-- Hint: You can also assign the 'Middle Click' action to other any other trigger like 'Button 4 Hold' etc. Learn more about triggers in this guide -->
