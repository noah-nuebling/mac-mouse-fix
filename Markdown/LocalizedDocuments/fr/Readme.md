  <!-- ||| Intro Text ||| -->

Mac Mouse Fix is an app that makes your mouse better.

I want to turn Mac Mouse Fix into the best mouse driver *of all time*! Some features are still missing at the moment, but I think it already **turns regular mice into the best input devices for Macs** in some ways. At the same level or even better than an Apple Trackpad or a Logitech MX Master mouse.

For more information on how exactly Mac Mouse Fix enhances your mouse, visit the [website](https://macmousefix.com/).

  <!--
    easy, efficient, natural and pleasant
    Better than an Apple Trackpad or a Logitech MX Master. (These are often considered some of the best input devices for Macs)

    It offers amazingly natural and polished gestures and smooth scrolling that let you breeze through macOS just like an Apple Trackpad.

    It lets you do almost anything right from your mouse with its powerful customization options that are so simple and intuitive that anyone can use them.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

Download the latest version of Mac Mouse Fix on the [website](https://macmousefix.com/).

You can also install Mac Mouse Fix through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)! Just type the following command into the terminal:

```bash
brew install mac-mouse-fix
```

You can download older versions of Mac Mouse Fix under [Releases](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases).

<a name="macos-compatibility"></a>
## macOS compatibility

The latest version of Mac Mouse Fix is made for **macOS 11 Big Sur** or later.
  
If you're on macOS **10.15 Catalina**, macOS **10.14 Mojave**, or macOS **10.13 High Sierra**, you can use the [latest version of Mac Mouse Fix 2](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=fr&target=mmf2-latest). Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.0 and later might still work on your machine, but they will have visual issues and some features might not work properly.
    
If you're on macOS **10.12 Sierra**, or **10.11 El Capitan**, you can use Mac Mouse Fix [2.2.0](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/2.2.0) or below.

<a name="pricing"></a> 
## Pricing

See the [website](https://macmousefix.com/#price) for an overview of the pricing for Mac Mouse Fix 3.<br>
Mac Mouse Fix 2 and below will remain free forever.

<a name="uninstallation"></a> 
## Uninstallation

Uninstall Mac Mouse Fix by simply moving it to the bin. 

However, there will be files left on your system. To get rid of these files I recommend the awesome [AppCleaner by FreeMacSoft](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/).

Under macOS, it is not feasible for apps to delete these leftover files by themselves when you delete the app. That's why I highly recommend using an app like AppCleaner.

## Tips

- **Manage windows with a simple Click and Drag**

  [Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/) is my favorite way to manage windows on macOS. With a simple swipe on your trackpad, it lets you position any window so it takes up half, a quarter, or the whole screen.
  
  Swish is designed for trackpad gestures, but with Mac Mouse Fix you can use it from any third-party mouse! Just go to Mac Mouse Fix and set any buttons "Click and Drag" action to "Scroll & Navigate" and then you can snap windows with a simple Click and Drag.
  
  Anything you can do with a two-finger swipe on an Apple trackpad works just as well with the "Scroll & Navigate" feature in Mac Mouse Fix.

- **Control Screen Brightness, Audio Volume, or Media Playback right from your mouse**

  Mac Mouse Fix lets you use **any key on your keyboard** directly from your mouse -
  even special keys only found on Apple keyboards that let you control Screen Brightness, Audio Volume, Media Playback, and more.
  
  If you don't have an Apple keyboard at hand, **hold Option (⌥)** to choose the special Apple keys.

<a name="questions"></a> 
## Questions

- **Is Mac Mouse Fix native on Apple Silicon?**
    
  Yes, Mac Mouse Fix runs 100% native on Apple Silicon.

- **Why is there a delay when I click?**

  When you click, Mac Mouse Fix might wait to see if you're going to double click.<br>
  To remove the delay for a button, delete any "Double Click" actions for that button.

- {{**How can I orbit around objects in 3D apps like Blender?**||questions.blender||}}

  ```
  key: questions.blender.body
  ```
  In 3D apps like Blender, you normally Click and Drag the Middle Mouse Button to orbit around objects.<br>
  But if you assign actions to the Middle Mouse Button in Mac Mouse Fix, then this won't work anymore.
  
  To solve this, I know of 2 options:
  1. Assign clicking and dragging one of the buttons of your mouse to the "Scroll & Navigate" feature. This feature simulates swiping with 2 fingers on an Apple Trackpad. This will, among other things, let you orbit in 3D apps! 
  2. *Uncapture* the Middle Mouse Button by deleting all actions assigned to it in Mac Mouse Fix. See [this guide](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mmf-captured-buttons-guide) for more info.

- **Can I open App Exposé through a Click and Drag Gesture?** <!-- Note: We're using App Exposé here and Application Windows in MMF. Not sure that's great. I felt this was clearer though. -->

  Yes! Just choose the 'Spaces & Mission Control' Action and then Click and Drag *down*.
  
  If this doesn't work, it's likely because the 'App Exposé' trackpad gesture is disabled on your Mac.<br>
  You can enable the gesture under System Settings or by running the following command in the terminal:
  
  ```
  defaults write com.apple.Dock showAppExposeGestureEnabled -bool TRUE; killall Dock
  ```
  
    <!-- ^^^ NOTES: Maybe we should automate this. For context, see Issue https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/387 -->

- **Are there 'App-Specific Settings' or 'Profiles'?**
  
  In Mac Mouse Fix 2, you can **disable features like Smooth Scrolling** under `More... > App-specific settings`.
  
  In Mac Mouse Fix 3, this feature doesn't exist yet. <br>
  Both 'app-specific settings' and 'mouse-specific settings' are planned, but I don't have a timeline yet for when they'll be released.
  
  **Tip:** Until 'app-specific settings' arrive in Mac Mouse Fix 3, you can do this:
  - Open the `General` tab
  - Turn on `Show in Menu Bar`
  - Now you can **disable features like Smooth Scrolling** directly from the Menu Bar
  
  I'm also interested to hear what your *use case* is. Feel free to submit a [feature request](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=fr&target=mmf-feedback-feature-request). Your input will help make the feature as good as possible once it arrives.
  <!-- ^^^ It's not a perfect solution, but I hope it helps a little until app-specific settings arrive. -->
  <!-- ^^^ Note: Us having to explain points at a bit of a UX failure I think. -->

- **Is my mouse supported?**

  Probably. If you want to know for sure, it's best to download Mac Mouse Fix and try it out.
  
  Mac Mouse Fix works very well with most mice. However, on certain mice designed to be used with proprietary driver software like Logitech Options, Mac Mouse Fix can't recognize all the buttons at the moment. 
  
  That's because these mice communicate with your computer using a special, proprietary protocol, instead of the standard USB protocol.<br>
  I would love to add full compatibility for these mice at some point, but it's a ton of work and it won't be coming soon.

- **Some buttons on my mouse are not recognized**

  See the question **"Is my mouse supported?"** above.

- **Is the Magic Mouse supported?**

  I might add features in the future which enhance the Apple Magic Mouse, but currently, Mac Mouse Fix has no effect on it.
  
    <!-- You can use SteerMouse or proprietary driver like Logitech Options instead. -->


    <!--
      - **How many buttons should my mouse have?**

        To get the best experience I recommend using Mac Mouse Fix with a mouse that has at least 5 buttons. If your mouse has fewer than 5 buttons, Mac Mouse Fix still provides rich functionality and a great experience, but some features will be less easy to access compared to a 5-button mouse. With a 5-button mouse, you can really breeze through macOS in a way that's just as nice as an Apple Trackpad!
        
        To learn more, see the [trackpad section](https://macmousefix.com/#trackpad) on the website.


      - **Mouse brands**

        I'm not the biggest expert on mouse hardware, but I do have quite a collection now, thanks to my work on Mac Mouse Fix! If I had to make a recommendation for what mouse to buy for the best experience with Mac Mouse fix, I'd say get a smaller, chinese brand on Amazon. In my experience, these mice often have better build quality at a fraction of the price of a big brand mouse like Logitech or Roccat. Also, some models of bigger manufacturers like Logitech are made to be used with their proprietary driver software, and they won't be fully compatible with Mac Mouse Fix. If you buy a smaller brand, you can usually be sure, that they will work flawlessly with non-proprietary drivers like Mac Mouse Fix.
    -->

- **Are tiltable scroll wheels supported?**

  Some mice let you tilt the scroll wheel left or right to scroll horizontally. Mac Mouse Fix will make this feel more natural and easy to control. However, it's not currently possible to trigger other actions, such as switching between desktops, by tilting the scroll wheel. I'd love to implement this feature at some point, but it's a ton of work and it won't be coming soon.
  
    <!-- This is so hard, because it would require reprogramming the mouse so that it sends button-signals instead of sending scroll-signals, when you tilt the scroll wheel. And to reprogram the mouse, would require communicating with the it through the custom vendor-specific protocol. And that's not easy. For many mice it's not even possible. -->

- **Turning off pointer acceleration**

  Mac Mouse Fix doesn't let you turn off the pointer acceleration, but if you're on **macOS 14 Sonoma** or later, you can turn off the pointer acceleration under `System Settings > Mouse > Advanced... > Pointer acceleration`.
  
  I plan to add really nice ways to improve pointer acceleration in the future, but I'm not sure when that's coming.

- **What's the difference between Mac Mouse Fix 2 and 3?**
  
  **Monetization:** <br>
  Mac Mouse Fix 2 is 100% free, and I plan to keep supporting it. <br>
  Mac Mouse Fix 3 is free for 30 days, then costs a few bucks to own. 
  
  **Features:** <br>
  Here's a [feature comparison](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=fr&target=mmf-version-2-vs-3). I wrote it shortly after Mac Mouse Fix 3 released – so it may be slightly out of date. <br>
  You can also download Mac Mouse Fix [2](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=fr&target=mmf2-latest) and [3](https://macmousefix.com/) for free to evaluate them yourself!

- **Does Mac Mouse Fix collect my data?**

  Mac Mouse Fix does not have ads, and it does not collect any personal information about you.
  
  However, at the moment that you buy the app, the sales provider Gumroad.com collects some personal info, such as your email address, and this info is visible to me. This is necessary to be able to issue refunds, send a license key to your email, etc. I cannot turn this off. To learn more about the data collected when you buy Mac Mouse Fix, see the [Gumroad Privacy Policy](https://gumroad.com/privacy).

- **How many devices can I use my license on?**
  
  Your license works on **all your Macs**. <br>
  The goal is that you can just buy a license, activate it, and never have to worry about it again. <br>
  If you log in with the same Apple Account, the license will even sync automatically to your other devices via iCloud!
  
  If you encounter problems activating your license, you can [send me an email](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=fr&target=mailto-noah). <br>
  I sometimes take a while to answer. I'm sorry about this. But I will get back to you!
  
  There is one restriction: <br>
  Licenses are not meant to be shared publicly. One license is meant for one person. Publicly shared licenses might be invalidated. (Your mom is not 'the public' and sharing with her is ok!)

  <!-- ^^^ Note: ChatGPT tells me I should mention that ppl can still use the license after they *upgrade* to a new device. Don't think that's necessary -->
  <!-- ^^^ TODO: Consider linking / copying this on the (Gumroad) checkout page. Ppl may not find it here. -->

- **Will my license work with future versions?**
   
  Your license covers all Mac Mouse Fix 3.x versions.
  
  Future versions, like 4.0, may require a new purchase, but I'll try to avoid this, unless it's necessary to support the continued development of the app.

- **Is there a refund policy?**

  There is no official refund policy, but the app is free for 30 days.
  
  If you experience any problems after buying the app, just reach out to me, and I will do my best to help.

- **Will Mac Mouse Fix still be Open Source now that it's monetized?**

  Yes, Mac Mouse Fix will still be open source!
  
  I encourage anyone to use the source code of Mac Mouse Fix in their own projects, as long as they don't release a simple copy of Mac Mouse Fix.
  
  Learn about the details in the [MMF License](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/blob/master/License) which Mac Mouse Fix 3 and later are licensed under.

    <!--
      , and I don't plan to change that at any point.
    
      This also means you can use Mac Mouse Fix for free by building it from source and disabling the licensing checks. That's perfectly fine, I just discourage sharing these cracked versions online.<br>
      And of course, on the next update, you'll get a non-cracked version which means you'll have to do this again for every update. (Or just pay $1.99 for the greatest mouse driver ever! :)
    -->

- **Can I get Mac Mouse Fix for free if I already donated?**

  Yes! If you donated via PayPal, click [here](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=fr&target=mmf-apply-for-milkshake-license) to receive a **free license**.

<!--

>>> [Jun 2025] These questions are super rare – I think I just added it here cause I find it interesting.
      ... If we ever wanna add these commented-out sections, we should probably edit them and make sure the links are correct and localized, too.


- **Will there be an iPad or Windows version of the app?** 

  That would be really cool, but it's not coming any time soon. iPad is currently lacking the necessary APIs, and either way I'd have to rewrite most of the app, which would take a lot of time. For now, I'm focused on making the macOS version as great as possible.

  (I wrote more about this [here](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/1437))

-->

<!--

>>> [Jun 2025] People will email me anyways, this doesn't really add anything I think.

- **I can't pay for the app. What can I do?** 

  I want Mac Mouse Fix to be accessible to everyone. If you can't pay for the app due to regional restrictions or any other reason, please [send me an email](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=fr&target=mailto-noah). Unfortunately, it may take me a while to answer, but I will get back eventually, and work on finding a solution.

-->

<!--

 >>> [Jul 2025] The fact that ppl continue to be confused about this is kind of a UX failure. This explanation shouldn't be necessary. I tweaked the UI text and hope it's better now.

- **Why does the Mac Mouse Fix window open when I start my Mac?** 

  This is likely because you've set Mac Mouse Fix as a macOS Login Item. Please see [Apple's Guide](https://support.apple.com/en-me/guide/mac-help/mh15189/mac) on how to manage Login Items. 
  
  Mac Mouse Fix works differently from many other apps. Once the 'Enable Mac Mouse Fix' switch is turned on, the app continues to affect your mouse even after you close the app or restart your computer. This means you don't need to add it as a Login Item to keep it working.

  **Background Info**

  This works because your mouse is not directly affected by the 'Mac Mouse Fix' app, but instead by the 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper' process, which runs in the background as long as the 'Enable Mac Mouse Fix' switch is turned on.

-->

<!--
>>> [Jun 2025] Commenting this out cause it's rare, and it's a stopgap measuere, and it' too much work to make good rn. Also, the scroll-uncapture notifications in feature-strings-catalog might clear up this confusion. Might re-enable if ppl continue to be confused. But perhaps, the 'how to stop MMF from intercepting Scroll / Buttons' stuff should be its own section. Sloppily wrote this, needs more editing <<<

- **Why do the 'Scrolling' and 'Buttons' items in the Menu Bar get re-enabled?**
    
  The Menu Bar buttons are meant to quickly, and temporarily turn off certain features while you're working in incompatible apps. 
  This is intended as a stop-gap-measure while there's no 'App-Specific Settings' feature, yet. <br>
  Curently the UI would break if these are enabled, so when you open the Buttons tab or Scrolling tab, they get toggled and stuff.
  To edit the settings in a permanent way, you can edit the settings in 'Buttons' and 'Scrolling' Tab. 
  
  To completely turn off all effects of Mac Mouse Fix on your buttons, delete all the actions on the 'Buttons' tab. <br>
  To completely turn off all effects of Mac Mouse Fix on your scroll wheel, configure the 'Scrolling' tab like this:
  <Insert screenshot>
  
  I know the current solution isn't amazing. But it allowed me to ship MMF 3.
  I plan to eventually replace the buttons in the Menu Bar with powerful App-Specific Settings.
