# 被捕获的滚轮

与[捕获鼠标按键](<../../Support/Guides/CapturedButtonsMMF3.md>)的机制类似，Mac Mouse Fix **在默认情况下会捕获鼠标的滚轮**。

**若要防止滚轮被捕获：**

1. 进入 Mac Mouse Fix 的“滚动”标签页
2. 关闭**所有**选项
    - 针对“速度”选项，将其设置为“macOS”
    - 点击每个修饰键旁边的“x”按钮，删除“键盘修饰键”下的所有条目

完成这些操作后，你应该会看到一条提示，说明滚轮已不再被捕获。

**当滚轮“不再”被捕获时，会发生什么？**

届时，Mac Mouse Fix 将完全忽略你的滚轮——在滚动期间，它不会消耗任何处理器性能或电池电量，也不会产生任何干扰。这让你能够完全自由地使用其他应用（如 [MOS](https://mos.caldis.me/)）来接管和处理你的滚轮。

    Notes / thoughts: 

    - Should we call it 'capturing' for the scrollwheel? [Sep 2025]
      - Contra: MMF doesn't hide the scroll-events or prevent any default-actions in the same way it does for mouse buttons. 
      - Pro: Capturing is just used like 'Intercepting' by us. The 'hiding from other apps' thing that happens for buttons isn't inherent (But is pretty core to our 'CapturedButtonsMMF3' explation)
    - Should this article even exist? [Sep 2025]
        - - I don't think it's relevant to many users, 
        - + I think it may prevent confusion if we have consistent Capture Toasts for both the 'Capturing sideeffects' on the Buttons and the Scrolling Tab?
        - + The few users for whom it is useful may really appreciate it.
        - - Maybe this should be a footnote at the bottom of CapturedButtonsMMF3.md?
        - - Maintenance overhead. I'm already not including screenshots here and keeping the step-by-step instructions vague to reduce maintenance overhead – and if we do it badly, maybe better not do it at all?
    - Style [Sep 2025]
        - Compared to CapturedButtonsMMF3.md this is **not** broken up into section for maximum scannability. 
        - This is just a long explanatory, text. 
        - Should we break this up into sections like CapturedButtonsMMF3.md for maximum scannability?
            - - More effort
            - - Less laid back / conversational tone (?) (Not sure why I value that. Feels sorta appropriate for this. Since in some way explaining how to use 'competitor' apps might seem like a conflict of interest and sorta weird if I do it in a sterile tone or something? Not sure I'm making any sense.)
            - Easier to parse for readers
        - Should the 'how to uncapture' explanation really be first? [Sep 10 2025]
            - - Most people might come from the uncapturing notification – They'll already know how to uncapture.
            - + The '**What happens when the scroll wheel is *no longer* being captured?**' explanation below feels more natural after the explanation of how to uncapture. (And I think *no longer* is less likely to be missed.)
    - Everything takes me so much time
        - We should just ship this and if I really hate it later I can change it. It won't affect very many people I think.
