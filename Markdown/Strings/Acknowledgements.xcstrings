'%1$@' is a format specifier in the C programming language, while '{url}' is a format specifier in the Python programming language. The idea is the same – when the program runs, this special character sequence gets replaced with dynamic content. You as the translator can decide where this dynamic content ends up in your translated text by including the format specifier in a specific place.\n\nAlso see: license-toast.activation-overload",
