Instead, the side buttons will only trigger the actions that you've assigned to them in Mac Mouse Fix.\n\n**Why does Mac Mouse Fix do this?** Mac Mouse Fix hides buttons from other apps to prevent you from accidentally triggering other functions while using Mac Mouse Fix gestures.\nFor example, if you click and drag button 4 to switch between desktops, you would always **simultaneously** go back a page in Chrome."
