    Note to self: None of Claude's translations into the other locales out of the human-translated ones (de, zh-Hans, ko, vi, cs, fr, pt-BR, ru, es, tr) had problems that I noticed. 
    NOTE2: All these translations were made before adding the 'Desired translations' so I don't know if Claude actually pays attention to them. 
    NOTE3: I hope talking about Claude not following instructions won't throw it off. 
        TODO: Remove this.
