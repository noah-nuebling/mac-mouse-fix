From the end of CTXTriggerStrings.md: (Moving it here to not accidentally throw Claude off.)
(
    Note to self: None of Claude's translations into the other locales out of the human-translated ones (de, zh-Hans, ko, vi, cs, fr, pt-BR, ru, es, tr) had problems that I noticed. 
    NOTE2: All these translations were made before adding the 'Desired translations' so I don't know if Claude actually pays attention to them.
